<p>
Spatially resolved transcriptomics is a cutting-edge molecular profiling technology that measures transcript expression and position within a tissue. This course will teach you how to analyze spatial transcriptomics data generated by the <a href="https://www.10xgenomics.com/platforms/visium">10X Genomics Visium</a> platform. By the end of this course, you will be able to:

<ul>
<li>Describe different spatial transcriptomics technologies and the best uses of each.</li>
<li>Identify important elements for good experimental design.</li>
<li>Analyze spatial transcriptomics data, including quality control, transcript quantification, and cell-type assignment within regions.</li>
</ul>
